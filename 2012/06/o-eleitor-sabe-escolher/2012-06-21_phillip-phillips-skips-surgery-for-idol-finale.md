MANILA, Philippines – “American Idol” finalist Phillip Phillips has skipped kidney surgery for the final week of the singing competition where he is pitted against Filipino-Mexican-American Jessica Sanchez, according to celebrity news site TMZ.


Citing “multiple Idol sources,” TMZ said Phillips has decided[Replica Watches](http://www.intentwatches.com/)


 to postpone surgery despite being “urged” by his doctor to go under the knife immediately.


Idol’s “last man standing” has been suffering from severe kidney problems but has chosen to put off surgery until the Season 11 winner is announced.


But according to TMZ, Phillips’s condition has worsened and it has reportedly affected his singing.


“Phillip's condition is taking its toll -- we're told the medication causes dry mouth, and it's had some impact on his singing,” the site said.


The condition also forced the 21-year-old crooner to miss the filming of the Ford commercials for American Idol.


Phillips made it to the show’s Top 2 when 19-year-old Joshua Ledet was sent home after he received the fewest votes last Thursday (Friday in Manila).


Phillips and Sanchez will take the Idol stage to perform 3 songs for the show’s finale on Tuesday (Wednesday in Manila).


The final results show will be held the following day and will feature pop star Rihanna and Season 10 winner Scotty McCrerry.
